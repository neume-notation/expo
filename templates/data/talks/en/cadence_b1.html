<p>Although we can no longer hear these melodies, we can work out some
aspects of how they sounded. One of the crucial things is where you stop,
and take a breath, and pause, and then start singing again, at the end
of a sentence, or at the end of a clause or a smaller text unit.
Of course, there is always a stopping point at the end of each chant.
Some of these notational combinations recur multiple times –
<span data-id="cadence-final">here’s</span> one
at the end of a chant,
<span data-id="cadence-other">and</span> there it is in the middle of the chant.
So even within one tiny fragment we can see recurring shapes on a
single page.</p>

<section data-id="cadence-find">
<p>At the end of one of the chants on this page, there’s this
<span data-id="cadence-find-eg">shape.</span>
It has a curve up, down again, and then a straight
line going off. And then on the next syllable there is a single note to
finish the phrase. <span data-id="cadence-find-game">Can</span> you
spot that combination somewhere else?
When you do, tap it with your finger on the screen.</p>

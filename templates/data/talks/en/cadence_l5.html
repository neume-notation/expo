<p>Although we can no longer tell how these melodies sounded, we can tell
some things about how they worked.  One of the key elements of a piece
of music is when you stop, and take a breath, and pause, and then start
again – at a cadence.  This happens at the end of a sentence, or at the
end of a clause, or a smaller unit of text.
<span data-id="cadence-final">Of</span>
<span data-id="cadence-other"></span>
course, there is always a cadence at the end of a chant.</p>

<section data-id="cadence-find">
<p>At the end of this chant we have <span data-id="cadence-find-eg">this</span>
shape: a two note fall with a hook.
We can’t read any notation on the next two syllables, but almost certainly,
it will have been single notes on each syllable.
<span data-id="cadence-find-game">Can</span> you spot this shape,
followed by a single note anywhere earlier in the same chant?
When you find it, tap on the screen at the right place.</p>

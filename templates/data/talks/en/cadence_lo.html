<p>Although we can no longer hear these melodies, we can work out
some aspects of how they sounded. One key element is the question of
when you stop, take a breath, pause, and then start singing again.
This happens at the end of a sentence, or at the end of a
clause, or a shorter text unit. <span data-id="cadence-final">One</span>
place, of course, that there is always a stopping point
is at the end of a chant<span data-id="cadence-other">.</span></p>

<p>Some of these combinations recur multiple times, as you can see.
<span data-id="cadence-find-eg">Here</span>
is a combination that appears on the words “veritas eius” (his truth).
There is a unison, a two note rise, one single note, and then this three
note neume: a note, a higher note, and then a lower note again.
<span data-id="cadence-find-game">Can</span> you spot this combination
later on the same page of the manuscript?
When you do, tap it with your finger on the screen.</p>

<p>Just one sheet of parchment survives from this manuscript. It has two
pages with writing on both sides.
<span data-id="codex-item1">The</span> front side of the first page has
part of the Mass for the fifth Sunday of Advent. This mass
<span data-id="codex-item2">ends</span> on the
back side of the first page. After the Mass we have material for
<span data-id="codex-pre-gap">two</span>
weekdays of Advent, and then we jump into the
<span data-id="codex-post-gap">middle</span> of Christmas day.
This means that between the weekdays of Advent and the page that has
Christmas day, there were other leaves of parchment sewn into the manuscript.
After the manuscript had fallen into disrepair, this fragment was used to
protect another newer book which contains psalms, canticles and
<span data-id="codex-stitching">hymns.</span></p>

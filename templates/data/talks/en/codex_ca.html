this manuscript survives. It has writing on both sides.
Some of its notation has been trimmed off the side, and this tells us that
the parchment was originally bigger. Another whole page very likely existed
on the left hand side of this manuscript.
<span data-id="codex-stitching">You</span> can see some stitching holes
on one side. They are not from the original manuscript because they cover
up the initial. They are more likely from a later binding, when this
fragment served as a flyleaf.</p>

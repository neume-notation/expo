<p>Just one page of parchment has survived from this manuscript. It has
writing on both sides.
<span data-id="codex-item1">It</span>
<span data-id="codex-item2">has</span>
<span data-id="codex-pre-gap">only</span>
<span data-id="codex-post-gap">one</span> chant, and prayers surrounding it.
This fragment very likely had another page on one of its sides.
<span data-id="codex-stitching">You</span> can
see some stitching holes. They are placed over part of the text of this
fragment, and this indicates that these stitching holes are not from
the original manuscript. Instead they were very likely produced when
this fragment was used to protect a newer liturgical book.</p>

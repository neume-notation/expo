<span data-id="codex-item2">one</span>
sheet of parchment survives from this manuscript. Originally,
it had two pages, written on both sides. But after it was separated from
the original manuscript, it lost the ink from one of the sides, because
it was used as a cover for a later book.</p>

<p>On the side that we can read, we have on the
<span data-id="codex-pre-gap">left</span> page the beginning of
an Old Testament reading and on the
<span data-id="codex-post-gap">right</span> page, the end of a New Testament
reading. This indicates that, in the original manuscript, there were more
sheets in between these two pages.
<span data-id="codex-stitching">If</span> you look at the middle of the
parchment, you will see the stitching holes, where this fragment was sewn
together with the other leaves of the booklet.</p>

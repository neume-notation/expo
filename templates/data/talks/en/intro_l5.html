<p>Christians in medieval Iberia had their own unique religious practices
until the end of the 11<sup>th</sup> century. About 40 manuscripts and
fragments preserve the texts and melodies that they used in their worship.
<span data-id="intro-the-ms">And</span>
that means that the fragment you see here is a rare and precious witness
to a cultural practice that was almost entirely suppressed after the
year 1080 AD.</p>

<section data-id="intro-text-elements">
<p><span data-id="intro-hl-text">The</span>
parts written in large text are the prayers, the readings and the
hymns. <span data-id="intro-hl-music">The</span>
parts written in small text are the more complicated chants,
and space is left above each line of text for the melody to be written.
At some point, our fragment got detached from the rest of its manuscript,
which might have had 200 or more pages, and just this one page survives,
by pure luck.</p>

<p><span data-id="intro-text-writing">The</span> text is in Latin.
The handwriting might be unfamiliar to you, but
once you learn the different shapes of the letters, it is easy to read.
<span data-id="intro-text-buttons">Although</span>
this is just a small fragment, we can tell the liturgical day
that it’s providing material for, and the different components of the
liturgy. The chant texts are drawn from the bible and, together with the
prayers, they offer the congregation a particular theological experience
of the liturgical day.</p>

<div data-id="intro-notation-pre"></div>
<section data-id="intro-notation">
<p><span data-id="intro-notation-shapes">In</span>
the musical notation, each sign goes up and down on the page as
the melody goes up and down, but there is no information about precise
pitch or intervals. The medieval singers reading the manuscript already
knew the melodies, and used the notation as a reminder.</p>

<p><span data-id="intro-notation-buttons">Even</span> in a small fragment
like this, we have identified dozens of
different notational shapes. Although the shapes do not tell us exactly
how these melodies sounded, we can identify how they divided the texts
into phrases. We have learned to identify the different melodic patterns
that appear at the ends of sentences. We have also learned how the melody
paces the text. <span data-id="intro-pace-long">Some</span>
syllables were stretched with lots of notes.
<span data-id="intro-pace-short">Other</span>
syllables had only one or a few notes, and were more similar to speech.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="intro-cadences">
<p><span data-id="intro-phrases">The</span>
chant you can see is preserved in a fragment held in the biblioteca
nacional in Madrid. In this chant, most syllables have up to four notes
each, but as we approach a phrase division,
<span data-id="intro-phrase-ends">there’s</span>
usually a syllable which is
<span data-id="intro-phrase-music">stretched</span>
out, with more like 5 or 6 notes each. In the middle of the chant,
<span data-id="intro-phrase-short1">there</span>
<span data-id="intro-phrase-short2">are</span>
<span data-id="intro-phrase-short3">three,</span>
very short, phrases. Then after that
broken up part of the text,
<span data-id="intro-phrase-long">there</span>
is one really long phrase, where they
work all the way through “that I took evil away from you”, and as you
can hear as I say it, that emphasises the flow of the text.
<span data-id="intro-phrase-creabo">Then,</span>
near the end, the word “creabo” (“I will create”), has 16 notes on it.
In that context, this is a real musical highpoint, and it means that
it gives the listeners a chance to meditate on that really important
word for longer than any other moment<span data-id="intro-end">.</span></p>

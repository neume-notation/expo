<section data-id="talk-beginning" class="text-position">
<p>This fragment begins with the final prayers of the mass for the
fifth Sunday of Advent.  We can see two
<span data-id="textbits-eucharist">Eucharistic</span> prayers that
follow the offering of the bread and the wine. Then we have the
<span data-id="textbits-post-nom">‘post nomina’,</span>
which prays for the dead. Following this, there is
an
<span data-id="textbits-ad-pacem">‘ad pacem’,</span>
which requests peace.
<span data-id="textbits-more-eu">Following</span> this, we have more
Eucharistic prayers.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="textbits-1">
<p>On the next page, we have the three closing prayers of the Mass:
<span data-id="textbits-completuria">a</span>
completuria, drawing together the main topics of the Mass;
the pater noster, or prayer of the Lord, which is indicated with
the
<span data-id="textbits-pr">abbreviation</span>
“PR”, and a
<span data-id="textbits-bene">benedictio,</span> which is a blessing.
Following this, there are two weekdays of advent. Each day started
with
<span data-id="textbits-vespers">vespers.</span>
Even though the vespers we see here was chanted on a
Sunday evening, it belongs to the liturgy of the Monday.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="textbits-2">
<p>This manuscript gives us
two vespers chants only. The first is an antiphon.
It has a
<span data-id="textbits-ant">main</span> section, a
<span data-id="textbits-ant-verse">verse,</span>
and it is associated with a Gloria.
The melody of the verse was so simple that it’s not written down;
people would know it by memory.
<span data-id="textbits-alleluia">The</span>
second chant is an alleluiaticus, which is an antiphon with alleluias.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="textbits-3">
<p>Following this, we see
<span data-id="textbits-adm">“Ad M”,</span> which is an abbreviation for
“ad matutinum” or “dawn service”. This service normally opened with
chants that are not written down here because they were repeated
every day, and would be memorised by the singers. Instead, we have
the chants that are specific for these days, and follow those
memorised chants.
These chants are:  an
<span data-id="textbits-chant1">antiphon and a prayer;</span>
<span data-id="textbits-chant2">another antiphon and a prayer;</span>
<span data-id="textbits-chant3">an alleluiaticus and another prayer;</span>
<span data-id="textbits-chant4">and finally a responsory.</span>
The prayers explain how the biblical texts
that are sung in the chants are relevant to the congregation.</p>
<p>The second
<span data-id="textbits-2nd-vr">VR</span>
marks the beginning of another vespers service,
and it also has an antiphon and an alleluiaticus. Following
this we have another
<span data-id="textbits-2nd-adm">“Ad M”,</span>
another “ad matutinum” or dawn service,
which has just the beginning of one chant.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="textbits-4">
<p>Between the left hand page and the right hand page, there were
more pages in the original manuscript. This is why we jump from
the beginning of a week of Advent into the middle of the Christmas
office on the right.
<span data-id="textbits-newbase">The</span> right hand page begins
<span data-id="textbits-canticle">halfway</span>
through a canticle. This is a biblical song with text drawn
from Isaiah, and it used a very simple melody. Its title is “Rorate caeli”.
Following this there are other chants: a
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-bene">benedictiones,</span> which is a
simple blessing chant; a
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-sono">sono,</span>
which is a very ornamented praising chant;
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-laudes">another</span>
praising chant called a laudes (“laudate dominum”), and then a
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-hymn">hymn</span>
(“A solis ortus cardine”). The hymn lacks notation
because its melody is very simple. This hymn uses verses that go
through the alphabet.
<span data-id="textbits-xacrostic">Here</span> we have F and G.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="textbits-5">
<p><span data-id="textbits-cont-hl">At</span>
the end of the dawn service, we find a set of three closing prayers: the
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-completuria">completuria,</span>
which draws together the topics of the service;
<span data-id="textbits-newbase2">the</span> pater noster or Lord’s Prayer,
which is represented with the abbreviation
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-pr">PR;</span> and a blessing or
<span data-id="textbits-xmas-bene2">benedictio.</span></p>
<p>The reverse side of the page has the beginning of the Christmas Mass.
The first reading has a
<span data-id="textbits-decorated">decorated</span> initial capital “I”.</p>
<p>This fragment has masses, vespers and dawn services.
This was the part of the Old Hispanic liturgy that was public. This means
that people who weren’t monks or clerics could attend these services.
Monks and clerics would also observe other hours privately,
and these hours were recorded in other liturgical books.</p>

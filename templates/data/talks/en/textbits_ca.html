<p>This fragment begins with a vespers service. The chant on the top
left is an alleluiaticus, which means an antiphon with alleluias.
It has a
<span data-id="textbits-main">main</span>
section and a
<span data-id="textbits-verse">verse.</span> The verse is drawn from the psalms
and its melody was so simple that it would be memorised, and therefore
it’s not written down here. The performance format of the alleluiaticus
is clearly specified in this fragment. The words
<span data-id="textbits-repeat">“et odor”</span> indicate the
part of the main section that is repeated after the verse; this is also
indicated with a percentage sign. After this repetition, a Gloria was
chanted.
<span data-id="textbits-rep-gloria">The</span>
red “G” signals the place that is repeated after chanting
the “Gloria”. After the alleluiaticus we find the
<span data-id="textbits-hymn">first</span> two words of a hymn:
“Christi katerva”. Hymns were normally written out in full versions in
another book, and their melodies were very simple.</p>

<section data-id="textbits-1">
<p>Then we find three
closing prayers: the
<span data-id="textbits-completuria">completuria,</span>
which draws together the topics of the
service, then the
<span data-id="textbits-newbase">“Pater noster”</span>
(or Lord’s Prayer) which is indicated
with the abbreviation
<span data-id="textbits-hl-pr">“PR”,</span> and finally the
<span data-id="textbits-benedictio">benedictio,</span>
which is a blessing.</p>
<p>Following this, we find the abbreviation
<span data-id="textbits-ad-m">“Ad M”.</span> This abbreviation
stands for “ad matutinum” or the dawn service. This service started with
the hymn
<span data-id="textbits-aeterne">“Aeterne rerum”.</span>
Following this hymn, we have three antiphons,
which were drawn from
<span data-id="textbits-psalm-3">psalm 3,</span>
<span data-id="textbits-psalm-50">psalm 50</span> and
<span data-id="textbits-psalm-56">psalm 56.</span> These four elements
were normally not written down in the liturgical books because they were
repeated very frequently, and the singers would memorise them. A series
of chants and prayers follow.
<span data-id="textbits-erit">Here</span> we have the first chant of the series,
the antiphon “Erit dominus”.
<span data-id="textbits-erit-verse">Its</span>
psalm verse is written out entirely.</p>

<section data-id="textbits-2">
<p><span data-id="textbits-cont-hl">This</span>
fragment has much more information than usual.
It specifies clearly how to navigate each service. This may show that
it was copied at a time when people were anxious about losing the
original shape of the Old Hispanic rite. Perhaps it was copied when
this liturgy was about to be replaced by the Roman
<span data-id="textbits-clear">liturgy.</span></p>

<section data-id="textbits-3">
<p>The prayers of this manuscript survive in only one other book,
from the eighth century. The chants also survive in a book from the
tenth century. This manuscript is particularly precious because it
demonstrates that these chants and prayers were used from
the eighth century for at least 300 years.</p>

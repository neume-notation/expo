<p>The first side contains the three prayers that close the rite
for visiting the dying.
The first is a completuria which draws together the themes of the rite.
Then there are the letters
<span data-id="textbits-hl-pr">“PR”,</span>
standing for “Pater”, or “Pater noster”,
the Lord’s prayer.</p>
</section>

<section data-id="textbits-1">
<p><span data-id="textbits-hl-pr-cont">This</span>
is followed by a benedictio, or blessing; this prayer starts on one
side and continues
<span data-id="textbits-newbase">over</span> to the other side,
and it ends with the letters
<span data-id="textbits-amen">“am”,</span> standing for amen.</p>
<p>The big block capitals mark the beginning of the rite for burying a
dead infant.
It starts with a responsory.  Responsories use biblical texts, often
from the psalter.
<span data-id="textbits-respond">It</span>
begins with a main section, or “respond”, followed
by a
<span data-id="textbits-verse">psalm</span>
verse, and then the last part of the respond is repeated.
In fact, the
<span data-id="textbits-repeat">word</span>
“quia” shows where in the respond the repetition starts.</p>

<section data-id="textbits-2">
<p>This is followed by another
<span data-id="textbits-prayer">completuria</span>
drawing together the elements of
this rite.  It commits the dead infant’s soul to
heaven, asking God to place it in the bosom of Abraham the Patriarch,
remembering its baptism, and reminding the faithful of Herod’s
slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem.</p>

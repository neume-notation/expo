<p>In the original manuscript, the right hand side of the fragment came
first – imagine it like a booklet, folded away from you. What we have
on this right hand page is part of the Mass for the Friday that’s just
over two weeks before Easter.</p>

<section data-id="textbits-1">
<p>First of all, we have the end of the
<span data-id="textbits-gospel">Gospel</span> reading, and then at the
end of that, there are little text cues for two chants:
<span data-id="textbits-praise">first</span>
of all, a praising chant (a laudes); and
<span data-id="textbits-scr">then</span> the sacrificium,
or offertory chant, which was sung while the bread and
wine are being prepared. Both of those chants will have been written out
in full earlier in the manuscript, and these few words are just given so
that the singers know which chant they are supposed to sing on this day.
Then there are two prayers, that were said before the sign of the peace.</p>

<section data-id="textbits-2">
<p>The left hand side of our manuscript came second in the original version.
Imagine it as the back cover of the booklet. This is part of the dawn
service for the Sunday two weeks before Easter.
<span data-id="textbits-newbase">We</span> start with the
<span data-id="textbits-sono">end</span>
of a sono. A sono is a very complex, elaborate chant, which has
many notes per syllable in some places. They were only used on
important days, like Sundays.
<span data-id="textbits-un-sono"></span>
<span data-id="textbits-laudate">After</span> that, there is a laudes, another
of these praising chants. That is followed by a
<span data-id="textbits-un-laudate"></span>
<span data-id="textbits-lectio">reading</span> which is marked
by “Lectio Iheremie”, “a reading from the book of Jeremiah”. This is a
really precious piece of information for us. Usually, readings and chants
are preserved in different books. So although we know which readings go
on different days, we don’t usually know where they go in the service.
This manuscript, because it has both the reading and the prayers and
chants tells us exactly where it fits on this day, which is after all
of those complex chants.</p>

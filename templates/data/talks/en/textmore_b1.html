<p>The services for the pre-Christmas season known as Advent draw much
of their material from the Old Testament prophets, such as Isaiah
and Jeremiah. Christians saw Jesus’s birth as the fulfilment of the
Old Testament prophecies. In the dawn service, three of our four
chants are from the Old Testament. In these chants, small bits of text
are extracted and put together to convey a coherent theme, as we can
see by looking at the first three chants.</p>

<p>In the Old Hispanic office, there is a strong tendency for closely
related chant texts to be sung in close proximity. This gives emphasis
to aspects of the text that are particularly relevant for the
liturgical season. Here, for example, three chants
successively begin with the words “Prope est”, “it is near”:
“The day of his coming is near”; “The day of the Lord is near”; and
“The Lord is near.” This repetition makes Christ’s arrival a central
focus.</p>

<p>The prayers that follow each chant add to this emphasis.
Each prayer begins by restating or paraphrasing the opening words
of the preceding chant.
<span data-id="textmore-chant">Here</span> for example, the chant begins,
“The Lord is near, you will not be troubled”.
<span data-id="textmore-prayer">The</span> following prayer
begins “Behold, now you are near, Lord. Let us always be
your neighbours, so that we may wait for your advent untroubled,
in no way troubled by cares we have neglected.” So the prayer
puts the words of the chant into the voice of the gathered faithful,
addressing God. Here, the message that the Lord is near is conveyed
several times, in similar but varied wording. This encourages the
participants in the liturgy to focus and meditate on these words.</p>

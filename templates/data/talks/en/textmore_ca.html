<p>The two chants preserved in this fragment were sung on the third
Sunday of Advent, during the five week period before Christmas, when
the Church anticipated Christ’s birth. Both chants are based on a
passage from Hosea, in which God encourages Israel to repent of her
sin and promises to heal her. Medieval Christians saw these types of
prophetic texts from the Old Testament as foreshadowing the birth
of Christ, and for that reason they were frequently included in the
Advent services.</p>

<p>In the Old Hispanic office, bits of scripture were often heard more
than once throughout the day, which reinforced their message. The
two chants included on these folios
<span data-id="textmore-begins">begin</span> with very similar text,
“I will be as the dew.” And “the Lord will be as the dew.” This
varied repetition underlines the importance of this text.</p>

<p>In the liturgy, the second chant, <em>Erit dominus,</em> was
followed by a prayer that further emphasised the ideas and imagery
in the chant, though we do not see the prayer in this fragment. The
chant text reads: “The Lord will be as dew. Israhel will bloom like
a lily, and her roots will shoot forth like Libanus”. The prayer is
a reflection on all of these images. It begins: “God, Christ, you
promise that you will call upon your Israhel with a sprinkling of
pleasing dew.” Then, it makes the chant personal: “make us bloom
like a lily in your house, just as our roots shoot forth with the
labours of virtue...” Together, the prayers and the chants
in the liturgy repeated
the same ideas and imagery, allowing ample opportunity for meditation
on this passage of scripture.</p>

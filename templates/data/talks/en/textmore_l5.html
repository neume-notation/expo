<p>The text of this poignant responsory is from Psalm 40. Perhaps its
most important phrase is “my enemy shall not rejoice over me.” In the
traditions of biblical commentary that were known on the Iberian
Peninsula, the enemy in this psalm is the devil. The devil has not
rejoiced over the speaker, because he is innocent. This is revealed
in the next line of text, “you have upheld me, because of my innocence.”
The whole chant, in fact, is focused on stressing the innocence of the
child who is being buried.</p>

<p>The first chant you see on the left side is a continuation of a sono,
“Dominus refugium”. The Roman numerals indicate the different sections
of the chant.  The part of the chant you see takes its text from Psalm 90.
First we have this: “he who dwells in the shadow of the most high shall
abide under the protection of the God of Jacob.” Then,
<span data-id="textmore-iii">at</span> Roman numeral III,
we have this text: “his truth will surround you with a shield; you should
not be afraid of the terror of the night, or of the arrow that flies by day,
or of those who walk about by night, of ruin, or of the noonday demon.”</p>

<p>Like most of the Old Hispanic chant, this text was chosen for the time
it was sung. This Sunday marked the mid-point of the penitential season
of Lent. During the second half of Lent, the church commemorated Jesus’
suffering and death. Many of the chants are thus about persecution.
This psalm was traditionally interpreted in the Christian tradition as
foreshadowing the time when Jesus was tempted by the devil.
For commentators such as Augustine, the words were also meant to
give strength to Christians who are persecuted.</p>

<p>The second chant on the page, “Laudate dominum,” is called a laudes,
which simply means “praise.” Its text always comes from one of the
psalms that incorporate the word “praise.” This one is based on Psalm 148:
“Praise the Lord from the earth, mountains and hills, fruitful trees and
cedars, for his name alone is exalted. He has exalted the horn of his
people; praise be to all his saints.”</p>

<p>Looking at the music of this chant, we can see that it has passages
where a long melody was sung without text, such as
<span data-id="textmore-exult">here</span> on “exalted.”
Medieval writers talked about this textless music as reflecting a joy
could not be expressed with words, and here this music seems to express
the joy inherent in the word “exalted.” Likewise,
<span data-id="textmore-laus">here</span> on the word “praise,”
one of the options was to sing
<span data-id="textmore-margin">this</span> very long melody without words,
that is written in the margin.</p>

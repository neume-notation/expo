<p>The original manuscript was pretty big – at least 35 by 50 cm when held
open. Several people could gather round a manuscript of this size, and all
look at it together. However, the text and notation are really small, so
you have to be very close to be able to read it.</p>

It was probably
a reference book, kept in a monastery or cathedral library, and referred
to when there was some question over the liturgy for the day. It was
certainly used in some way because it has been revised.
<span data-id="useofms-add1">In</span> the margin,
there is a new version of the melody on the word “terra”. Some of the
notation has been
<span data-id="useofms-add2">scraped</span>
<span data-id="useofms-marks"></span>
away, and replaced with different notation, in
a different handwriting.</p>

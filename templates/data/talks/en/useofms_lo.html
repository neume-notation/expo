It was
probably a reference book, kept in a monastery or cathedral library,
and referred to when there was some question about the liturgy for the

Clearer melodies have been written in the margin, for the words
<span data-id="useofms-add1">“exultate”</span> and
<span data-id="useofms-add2">“laus”.</span>
<span data-id="useofms-marks">Marks</span>
under the text seem to show where phrases
begin and end. They suggest that the manuscript was used after it was
